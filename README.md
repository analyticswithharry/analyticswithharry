## About

I analyse large-scale datasets, construct predictive models, and translate complex information into strategic insights that drive measurable outcomes.

My work integrates:

- Machine Learning Engineering  
- Quantitative Finance  
- Statistical Modelling  
- Open-Source Framework Development  

I am motivated by building intelligent systems that create long-term economic, societal, and environmental impact.
