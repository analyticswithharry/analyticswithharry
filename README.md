  Based in Glasgow, Scotland

I work with large datasets, build predictive models, and turn data into practical insights that support better decision-making.

My interests are mainly in:

- Machine Learning  
- Quantitative Finance  
- Statistical Modelling  
- Open-Source Development  

I enjoy building systems from scratch to understand how they work at a deeper level.  
My long-term goal is to apply technology in ways that create meaningful and responsible impact.
